# Project Summary: Amazon Stock Price Prediction

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict Amazon stock prices using machine learning techniques. The primary focus is to build a regression model that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data, specifically Amazon’s stock price and trading volume. The workflow involves steps like exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and validation using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.

## Challenges
Throughout the project, several challenges were encountered:

1. **High Error Rates in Initial Predictions**: In the early stages, the linear regression model exhibited high error rates, indicating that the predictions were not close to the actual stock prices.

2. **Scaling and Normalization**: The stock volume data had a wide range, leading to issues in the model's learning process. Normalizing the data was necessary to improve model performance.

3. **Model Validation**: Ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data while avoiding overfitting was crucial, as stock prices can be highly volatile and complex to predict.

## Solutions
To overcome these challenges, the following solutions were implemented:

1. **Data Normalization**: The Amazon stock volume data was normalized to bring it into a comparable range with stock prices. This step was critical for improving the performance of the regression model.

2. **Cross-Validation**: A 5-fold cross-validation strategy was employed to evaluate the model’s performance across different data splits. This ensured that the model was tested on multiple subsets, providing a more reliable estimate of its accuracy.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Basic time-based features, such as the day of the week and the month, were added to capture temporal patterns in the stock price data. Feature selection was kept minimal due to the project’s scope.

## Roadblocks
1. **Interpreting High Errors**: Initial model runs showed high Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values, particularly for unseen data, complicating trust in the model’s predictions.

2. **Improving Model Accuracy**: Despite cross-validation, the model’s predictive accuracy remained lower than desired, necessitating additional steps to optimize and test the approach.

## Conclusion
After applying 5-fold cross-validation and normalizing the data, the model's performance improved. The validation process underscored the importance of robust evaluation techniques like cross-validation, which provided a better understanding of the model’s strengths and weaknesses. The final error metrics, including MAE and RMSE, indicated reasonable accuracy for stock price prediction, though there remains potential for improvement.

Future steps could include integrating more relevant features (e.g., financial indicators or external market data) to enhance prediction accuracy and experimenting with more complex regression models.
